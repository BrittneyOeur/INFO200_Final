## Problem Statement
The team’s primary focus is to address a challenge within the University of Washington (UW) student community. The problem that will be investigated and addressed is the inadequate and disorganized information regarding the scheduling and locations of various events taking place on the UW campus. This includes club meetings, career fair events, and any other university-related gatherings.

This problem must be addressed because the current state of event information is convoluted and difficult to navigate. The confusion that this causes may lead to frustration and discouragement among students who wish to participate in these events.

Solving this problem would help UW students positively because they would be less confused and foster greater enthusiasm for event participation. This in turn can help enhance their UW experience. Attending these events can help students make friends, but also provides an opportunity to acquire new knowledge of something they may be interested in. This positive impact on students' social connections and educational experiences underscores the importance of addressing the issue.

### Critical Issues to be Addressed:
- **Lack of centralized information:** Events across different departments and clubs are not effectively centralized or accessible in one location, making it challenging for students to find comprehensive information.
- **Information fragmentation:** The scheduling and location details of various events are scattered across multiple platforms, leading to confusion and difficulty in tracking and accessing relevant event details.
- **Accessibility issues:** The current system may not cater to all students' needs, potentially excluding those who rely on specific types of communication or platforms for event information.
- **Impact on student engagement:** Inadequate event information may result in reduced participation, affecting students' ability to engage with the campus community, find new opportunities, and expand their social and academic networks.

## Selected Solution
The proposed solution entails developing a comprehensive events website accessible to all members of the UW community—students, professors, and staff. This platform, accessible via computers, tablets, or phones, consolidates all ongoing events and offers customizable filters for specific searches. By centralizing event information scattered across various websites and social media platforms, this solution significantly simplifies event discovery. 

Moreover, this website allows users to bookmark events they're interested in and easily RSVP—all within a single platform. Its advantage lies in universal accessibility across electronic devices, unlike mobile apps restricted to phones, eliminating the need for physical presence on campus as required by flyers. 

Through the interviews with UW students, it became evident that they strongly desire a unified platform for all UW events. Navigating through disparate campus event pages was perceived as confusing and time-consuming. Therefore, the proposed solution addresses this need for a streamlined and user-friendly interface, minimizing the hassle of seeking information across multiple sources.

**The benefits of this solution resonate deeply with the stakeholders:**
- **Stakeholder 1:** Student Body Students engage directly with the system. The design aims to overcome existing shortcomings in advertising and information availability, ensuring sustained student involvement and preventing reliance on alternate, less efficient methods for event discovery.
- **Stakeholder 2:** Student Organizations (RSOs, RCSA, RPB, HFS). The directory and event calendar in the new system will assist student organizations in attracting and engaging students more effectively. Ensuring updated and comprehensive information entry from these student organizations can help increase event promotion and organizational growth.
- **Stakeholder 3:** UW Faculty & Staff The new system aligns with UW's mission of community engagement by providing broader access to school resources and supporting student organizations. Improved outreach capabilities will better represent UW's commitment to student activities and community involvement.
  
Ultimately, this user-centric design not only simplifies event discovery but also addresses the specific needs and aspirations of the stakeholders. By providing a unified, intuitive platform, the aim is to foster a further connected and engaged UW community, benefitting both users and stakeholders alike.
